# Duel-Way Connections

Let's make some duel way connections between stuff.

My primary focus here is to make a duel way connection between `.NET` & `NextJS`. But that is not much challenging. What could be challenging is making a duel way connection between much heterogeneous stuff. I add an extra `NodeJS` server to make it more challenging.

`.NET` has a nice library called `SignalR` which is a real-time communication library. It has a client library for `JavaScript` which can be used in `NextJS`. But what about `NodeJS`? When it comes to real-time communication in `NodeJS`, the first thing that comes to mind is `Socket.IO`. Looks like it is a challenge to make `SignalR` and `Socket.IO` work together. Let's see how it goes.
